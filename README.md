# EduARise
EduARise aims to revolutionize education through augmented reality. This application is designed to create an interactive and immersive learning experience for elementary school children.

Conventional textbooks often struggle to convey complex concepts effectively. EduARise addresses this by transforming 2D images into 3D views, allowing students to scan these images and explore them in a more engaging and comprehensible manner.

With EduARise, we strive to make learning more accessible and enjoyable by bringing static images to life, enhancing students' understanding of challenging subjects.
